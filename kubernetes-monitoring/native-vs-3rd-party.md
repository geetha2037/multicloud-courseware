# Native vs. 3rd Party Monitoring

* Kubernetes Native monitoring is a collection of tools, the learning curve is steep
* With Kubernetes native tools knowledge is interoperable
* Cloud providers focus on their own Kubernetes implementation
* Monitoring other Kubernetes clusters is lesser of a priority
* Lock-in for cloud provider native tools is a norm
* For a 3rd party provider, seamless integration with many Kubernetes providers is a competitive advantage
* 3rd party provider focus is on-the-cloud and on-premises clusters monitoring
