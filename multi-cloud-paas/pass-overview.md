# PaaS Overview

* Category of cloud computing services allowing to develop, run, and manage applications
* No complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure
* Application developers package their code, push the package, and PaaS runs the code
* Multiple programming languages are supported, typically: Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, and Dotnet
* PaaS often supports deployment/configuration automation, blue/green deployment, auto-scaling and auto-healing
* Provider native platforms: [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/), [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/), VMWare, and OpenStack
* Interoperable platform: [Pivotal Cloud Foundry \(PCF\)](https://pivotal.io/platform) can be installed on [Aws](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/customizing/aws.html), [Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/pivotal.pivotal-cloud-foundry), and [GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/customizing/gcp.html)
* Interoperable PaaS is an extra level of abstraction, with pros and cons
* Deploy to different cloud providers seamlessly
* Avoid a lock-in with a cloud provider and find a lock-in with the interoperable provider
