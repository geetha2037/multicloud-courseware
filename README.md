## Overview

There is plenty of courses and certifications specific to a cloud provider  
Understandably, every cloud provider pursues its own interests of locking customers in  
The common thought in an organization: we don't want to be locked-in with a cloud provider  
There is a number of possible solutions for maintaining cloud interoperability:

* Run all workloads on virtual machines without a dependency on cloud-specific services
* Run all workloads in containers leveraging [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* Rely on a 3rd party Platform-as-a-Service e.g. [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform)
* Introduce an adapter pattern into your software to abstract business logic from cloud-specific code

The purpose of this course is to analyze the pros and cons of the different approaches  
And to experience the different approaches with pragmatic hands-on labs and group discussions

## Audience

* Software architects evaluating the strategies for an inter-cloud and multi-cloud deployment models
* Software developers writing code that needs to run on different or multiple cloud providers
* DevOps engineers that will be implementing inter-cloud ci/cd

## Course's Objectives

* Review the common design patterns deployment models: IaaS, PaaS, KaaS, DBaaS, and Serverless
* Highlight best design practices for the cloud-native applications: [the twelve factors app](https://12factor.net/)
* Automate deployment of IaaS to a couple of public cloud providers: Aws, GCP or Azure leveraging [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* Contrast a cloud-specific logging and monitoring facilities to a centralized logging/monitoring services leveraging 3rd party service
* Demonstrate the process of authoring a Dockerfile to run the end-point application in a container
* Make use of Kubernetes as a service to deploy and monitor the created image
* Get familiar with Pivotal Cloud Foundry PaaS concepts for multi-cloud deployment
* Deploy end-point to Pivotal PaaS and access logs/monitoring tools
* Convert the end-point to a serverless function and deploy to a couple of cloud providers: AWS, GCP, or Azure
* Analyze serverless logs and monitoring
* Discuss the data persistency options compatible with inter-cloud deployments
* Review common security and regulatory concerns

## Prerequisites

* Previous experience with public cloud providers: Aws, GCP, or Azure
* Familiarity with Micro-services concepts
* Recent hands-on experience with terminal/command line
* Database and data-modelling awareness
* The notion of security and compliance concerns
* Access to AWS, GCP, Azure account, free trial is sufficient
* Willingness to register a free trial account on JumpCloud, DataDog and Pivotal Web Services
