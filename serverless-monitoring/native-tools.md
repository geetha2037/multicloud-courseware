# Native Tools

* Aws integrates serverless applications monitoring into CloudWatch
* Azure provides insight into Function App from the web console
* GCP collects metrics and logs from Cloud Function into Stackdriver
* Kubernetes comes with its own monitoring tools and usually integrated into cloud-native tools
* The objective of the monitoring is similar to PaaS and IaaS, to provide visibility into metrics and logs
* The responsibility, however, is reduced as cloud infrastructure addresses the scalability and the fault tolerance
