# Lab: End-Point in a Container

1. Open a web browser to [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. From the services select Cloud9 and open the environment we used before for terraform setup
3. Open a terminal and clone the repo with end-point source code:  
    `git clone https://github.com/vkhazin/courseware-nodejs-container.git`

4. Review the `*.js` files under `api` folder to get an idea of the source code
5. To build a docker image execute: `docker build ./ -t node/end-point`
6. Expected result: `...Successfully tagged node/end-point:latest`
7. To run the newly created image we need to create a container from it
8. Images are immutable, containers can mutate over their lifecycle
9. To launch a new container execute: `docker run --name node-end-point -d --rm -p 3001:3001 node/end-point`
10. `--name` gives our container a name
11. `-p 3001:3001` maps host port 3001 to container port 3001
12. `-d` starts detached to be able to continue using the terminal
13. `--rm` deletes the container when it is stopped
14. And now you are able to access the endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3001/?name=John`
15. This is how you create a node.js end-point running in a container
16. To delete the container: `docker rm node-end-point -f`
17. To delete the image: `docker rmi node/end-point`
18. There are a couple of yml files in the repository we will discuss in the next lab
