# Manual Infrastructure

* A ticket is required for a new VM by a developer
* Another ticket is for a firewall port opening by a software architect
* Another ticket for the load-balancer configuration by a team lead
* A couple of meetings to review the requirements
* A possible escalation through a VP due to a short notice
* A push back due to limited storage capacity in the data centre
* Manual configuration of VM, Load-Balancer and Firewall by different individuals/teams
* Manual configuration by the developer for each provisioned VM
* An error-prone, hardly reliable or easily reproducible process
* Scalable to dozens, maybe, hundreds of instances and a low churn
