# Logs & Auditing

* Logs aggregation is, usually, a challenge on-premises
* Less of an annoyance with a single cloud provider, log aggregation is built-in
* In addition to collecting logs, there are facilities to automate alerts and alarms on logs
* More of a noyance with multiple cloud providers, logs need to be consolidated
* Ideally, access provisioning is automated
* Realistically, manual changes do occur in sensitive environments
* Monitoring of access control is, therefore, desirable
