* There are, at least, two components: Authentication and Authorization
* Authentication: who you are 
* Authorization: what can you do
* Cloud providers and marketplace vendors implement security roles and policies
* It is a bit optimistic to aim for all-universal authorization method
* Single Sign-on is a recipe for ensuring access terminated at once
