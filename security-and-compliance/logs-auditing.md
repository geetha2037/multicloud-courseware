# Logs & Auditing

* Logs aggregation is, usually, a challenge on-premises
* Less of an annoyance with a single cloud provider as log aggregation is part of the offering
* In addition to collecting logs, there are facilities to automate alerts and alarms on log's data
* More of a nuisance with multiple cloud providers where logs need to be consolidated
* Ideally, access management is fully automated
* Realistically, manual changes do occur, even, in the most sensitive environments
* Monitoring of access control changes is, therefore, highly desirable
