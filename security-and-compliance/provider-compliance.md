# Cloud Provider Compliance

* AWS is part of [40 certifications programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)
* Azure has over [90 compliance certifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/trusted-cloud/compliance/)
* GPC overs over [40 compliance offerings](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/offerings/#/)
* A pet peeve: different terminologies are used
* A concern: what if a provider fails an audit in the future
* A warning: marketplace offering may not comfort to the same level of compliance
* The last resort: implementing your own compliance on a non-compliant provider
